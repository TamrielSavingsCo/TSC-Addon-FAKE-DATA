# TSCPriceDataLite

A lightweight ESO addon providing price data from Tamriel Savings Co. This is a simplified version that provides just price lookups.

## Quick Start

**Users**: Install and forget - this addon provides price data to the Tamriel Savings Co Price Fetcher Addon, and your other addons if they use Tamriel Savings Co price data.

**Developers**: Simple API with comprehensive Xbox NA market data. See API below.

## API

The addon exposes a single function:

```lua
local price = TSCPriceDataLite:GetPrice(itemId)
```

### Input
- `itemId`: Number - The ESO item ID (obtained from game API calls like `GetItemLinkItemId()`)

### Output
- Returns a number representing the item's price if found
- Returns `nil` if:
  - Item not found in database
  - Invalid input
  - Any error condition

### Example Usage

```lua
-- Basic price lookup
local itemId = GetItemLinkItemId(itemLink)
local price = TSCPriceDataLite:GetPrice(itemId)

if price then
    -- Price found
    d("Item price: " .. price)
else
    -- No price data available
    d("No price data for this item")
end
```

## Data Structure

The addon uses a space-efficient data structure internally:

```lua
PriceData = {
    [itemId] = price,            -- Direct price entry
    [itemId2] = "referenceId",   -- Reference to another item's price
}
```

Items that share the same price (different traits) use references to avoid data duplication. This is handled transparently by the API - consumers don't need to know about the reference system.

## Version Support

- Version numbers follow the format YYYY.MM.DD (e.g. 2025.06.01) indicating when the price data was last updated
- Price data is updated weekly with the latest market prices
- Check your addon version against the current date to know how fresh your price data is
